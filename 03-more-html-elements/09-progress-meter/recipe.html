      <h2>Chockolate Chip Cooking Recipe!</h2>
      <!-- This is Rustam's Cookie Company best-selling recipe -->
      <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed light-brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Baking Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugars with an electric mixer on
          medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the salt, vanilla, and eggs,
          and beat until well mixed, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually add the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Stir in
          the chocolate chips.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drop heaping tablespoon-sized balls of dough about 2 inches apart on
          baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake until cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the
          center, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking
          sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool
          completely.
        </li>
      </ol>
